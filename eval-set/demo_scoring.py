"""Demo: how to score a recommendation with the four-layer evaluator.

Uses app-08 (the cross-tier database cascade scenario) as a canonical
example. Constructs the Evaluator, scores the gold recommendation
against its own scoring rules, and prints the per-layer verdict.

Default mode runs Shape + Correctness only (no API key required). Pass
--with-judge to additionally call the LLM judge on Mid and Rich; this
requires either OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in the environment
(loaded from .env). When both are set, OpenAI is preferred.

To verify all 18 gold answers still pass their own deterministic layers,
run the integration test instead:

    pytest tests/integration/test_golden_answers.py

Run this demo:
    python eval-set/demo_scoring.py              # Shape + Correctness only
    python eval-set/demo_scoring.py --with-judge # adds Mid + Rich via LLM
