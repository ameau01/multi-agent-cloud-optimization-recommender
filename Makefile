# Common workflows wrapped behind one-word targets.
# Run `make help` to see them.
#
# Target invocations use `./scripts/foo.sh` (not `bash scripts/foo.sh`) so
# Make doesn't pick the shell — each script's own `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
# shebang does. The scripts themselves require bash (they use [[ ]],
# arrays, etc.), but Make doesn't have to know that.
