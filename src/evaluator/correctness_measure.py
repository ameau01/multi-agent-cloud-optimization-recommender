"""Layer 2: Correctness (the hard gate).

Strict equality on the four enum decision fields. A prediction passes
Correctness only when finding_type, primary_tier, secondary_tier, and
action_category all match the per-scenario allowed list (which under the
current design is a single-value list matching the gold).

This is the gate. When Correctness fails, Mid and Rich are skipped (the
caller / Evaluator class enforces that). A wrong-tier or wrong-finding-type
recommendation should fail here regardless of how well-structured the rest is.

Also exposes score_floor as a back-compat alias that merges Shape +
Correctness. Older callers (tests, CLI's --tier floor flag) use it.
