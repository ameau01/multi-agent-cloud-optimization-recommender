"""Shared helpers used by the scoring layers.

Lives outside the per-layer measure modules because more than one of them
uses these functions. Following the package convention that everything
under src/evaluator/ is implementation detail by location, this module
does not use the `_helpers.py` leading-underscore prefix.

Reserve the `_xxx.py` filename pattern for files that are MORE private
than their neighbors (rare). For this project, locating a file under
src/evaluator/ is sufficient signal that external callers should reach
it through the Evaluator class or the tiers.py facade, not directly.
