"""Layer 3: Mid (evidence engagement, scored by LLM judge).

Mid is the lower richness threshold. A prediction passes Mid when the
LLM judge scores its `specific_change` prose at or above MID_THRESHOLD
(currently 30) when compared against the gold's `specific_change`.

The judge call itself is made once per scenario in Evaluator.score_one()
and the result is shared between Mid and Rich. This module is a pure
score-interpreter; it does not call the LLM.

Short-circuit rule: when the prediction's finding_type is in
NO_ACTION_FINDINGS, Mid passes automatically with a single 'short_circuit'
check (no judge call needed; there is no action to assess richness on).

Graceful degradation: when no judge_result is provided (e.g., because no
API key is set), Mid returns a single 'skipped' check that reports
passed=True but message="judge unavailable; layer skipped". This keeps
the report-format contract: callers always see four-layer output.
