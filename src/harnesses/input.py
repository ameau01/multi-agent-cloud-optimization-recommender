"""Input Harness — validates the ingest bundle before any reasoning runs.

What it actually checks today (first implementation):

  - `validate_trigger`  — the review trigger is well-formed (the
    application_id matches the published-dataset shape `app-NN`).
  - `validate_application_known` — the application_id is one this system
    knows about (i.e. listed in the published dataset).

What it will check in a later phase (declared here for design honesty,
not yet implemented):

  - Schema conformance of telemetry tier arrays.
  - Record completeness (1,344 records per tier across 14 days).
  - Timestamp continuity (15-minute intervals, no gaps).
  - Cross-tier timestamp alignment.
  - Sidecar field presence for scenarios that need it (top_queries,
    per_instance_breakdown).
  - Terraform parseability.

The later checks are best implemented when the dataset is loaded — this
class accepts an optional `bundle` argument on `validate_bundle` that
returns NotImplementedError today so the surface is visible without the
implementation blocking the rest of the phase.

Every check writes a `harness_trail` row keyed by `check_name` and
returns a `ValidationResult` to the caller.
