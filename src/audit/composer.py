"""Reconstruct a Composite from a cycle's records.

The audit store records every reasoning event as an audit_record. The
renderer consumes a Composite (with a populated TraceSection). The
composer bridges the two — it reads the cycle's records and assembles
a fully-populated Composite that the renderer can hand to its existing
render_report and render_trace functions unchanged.

This is what "the audit trail is the source of truth for the trace
section" means in practice: the trace_section field is NEVER written
into the recommendation record; it is always derived from the cycle's
audit_records at read time, via this composer.
