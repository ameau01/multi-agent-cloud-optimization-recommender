"""AuditStore — the single class callers use to persist audit records.

Responsibilities:
  - Resolve the SQLite database path from AUDIT_DB_PATH env (or override),
    creating the parent directory if missing.
  - Open a SQLAlchemy engine with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;` on every
    connection — SQLite does not enforce FKs by default, and the audit
    trail's "every parent reference resolves" claim depends on this.
  - Idempotently initialize the schema (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS).
  - Provide append-only insertion helpers; no update_* methods exist.
  - Encapsulate the cycle_id uniqueness invariant via start_cycle().
  - Provide the evaluator integration via evaluate_recommendation().

See `docs/audit-trail.md` for the full design.
