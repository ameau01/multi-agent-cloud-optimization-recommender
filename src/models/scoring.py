"""Pydantic models the evaluator emits.

Three model groups:
  - CheckResult / TierResult: per-layer scoring atoms returned by the
    score_shape / score_correctness / score_mid / score_rich helpers.
    Migrated from dataclass (formerly src/evaluator/types.py) so they
    serialize via model_dump() and gain JSON Schema for free.
  - JudgeResult: the LLM judge's structured verdict for the richness
    layer.
  - ScoreOneResult: the full five-layer scorecard returned by
    Evaluator.score_one(). Each layer is either a TierResult or the
    literal string "skipped" (when correctness fails and Mid/Rich are
    gated off).

All models are strict (extra='forbid'); these are internal evaluator
outputs and any unexpected key indicates a bug.
