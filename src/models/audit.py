"""Pydantic models for the audit trail.

Three top-level record types map 1:1 to the three SQLite tables documented
in `docs/audit-trail.md`:

  - `AuditRecord`     -> audit_records table (the reasoning trail)
  - `HarnessRecord`   -> harness_trail table (enforcement events)
  - `InternalOpRecord` -> operations table (eval, render — internal)

Each record's `content` field is a typed Pydantic sub-model whose shape
is selected by `type`. The content classes are defined below in four
sections (decision-category content, evidence-category content) for
audit_records, a section for operations content, and a fourth section
for harness_trail content.

The store layer accepts records as raw dicts at the wire (so producers
can use simple JSON-able payloads) and validates them against these
models on insert. Read paths return typed instances; queries that don't
care about content can keep it opaque.

See `docs/audit-trail.md` for the column-level schema and the rationale
for the three-table split.
