"""Pydantic output schemas for the MCP server's tools.

Every tool in `src/mcp_server/tools/` annotates its return as one of the
response classes defined here. FastMCP:

  - publishes the JSON Schema as the tool's `outputSchema`
  - serializes the response with shape validation server-side
  - populates `structuredContent` for newer MCP clients

The file is organized in four sections:

  1. Base envelopes — shared by every per-app response (AppResponse,
     TierResponse, TierMetricResponse). Pure Python inheritance; the
     wire shape is flat (Pydantic flattens inherited fields).
  2. Record types — the element shape inside any `list[...]` field
     (TimeSeriesPoint, ThresholdBreach, DistributionBin, TopQueryRecord,
     TopCacheKeyRecord, InstanceRecord, CorrelationRecord, CostByTier).
  3. Body payloads — the named-body half of envelope+body responses
     (MetricStatistics, TimePattern, MetricDistribution, BusinessContext,
     SlaTarget, CostBaseline, BeforeAfterEvidence). Names carry no
     "Payload" suffix; the meaningful distinction is Response vs body.
  4. Response envelopes — one per MCP tool (17 of them; the eighteenth,
     `get_handcrafted_recommendation`, reuses `src.models.composite.Composite`).

Three responses adopt the envelope+body pattern explicitly with a
nested body field (statistics, time_pattern, distribution); three more
already had it (business_context, cost_baseline, before_after_evidence).
The threshold-breach response keeps a flat shape on purpose because
its fields are semantically mixed (echoed inputs + derived count +
list-as-body); forcing a wrapper would bundle things that don't
belong together.

For the deferral reasoning on TimestampedValue, threshold-breach
normalization, and generic TierBuckets, see the "Future extractions,
deferred" subsection in `docs/mcp-server.md`.
