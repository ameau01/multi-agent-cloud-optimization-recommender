"""Cross-cutting Literal types shared by Pydantic models and store layers.

This is the single home for type vocabulary used by multiple subsystems:

  - `Tier` — the four canonical infrastructure tiers, used by MCP responses,
    scope.py allow-lists, evaluator validators, audit AgentName context.
  - `FindingType`, `ActionCategory` — domain enums used by Composite, the
    evaluator, and audit event content.
  - `AgentName` — the 12 agents and harnesses that can produce audit records.
  - `RecordCategory`, `RecordType` — audit-trail event taxonomy.
  - `HarnessName`, `Verdict`, `HarnessRecordType` — harness_trail vocabulary
    (the second table, recording enforcement events).

The frozenset-based runtime universes (FINDING_TYPES, PRIMARY_TIERS, etc.)
that the evaluator's rules-validator uses live in `src/evaluator/enums.py`
and are derived from these Literals — this file is the single source of
truth, the evaluator's frozensets are runtime projections.

When adding a new value:
  1. Add it to the appropriate Literal here.
  2. The evaluator's frozenset auto-includes it via re-derivation.
  3. Update `docs/eval-set.md` enum reference + any composite gold
     answers that should use the new value.
