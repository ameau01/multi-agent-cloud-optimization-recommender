"""The AnalysisPlan: System Mapper's output, Supervisor's input.

The System Mapper parses the application's terraform + metadata and
produces an AnalysisPlan describing which infrastructure tiers are in
scope and which tier specialists should be invoked. The Supervisor
reads this plan and fans out to the named specialists.

Kept in its own module because it's the protocol between two distinct
agents — both agents import it; neither owns it.
