"""LangGraph state schema — the contract every node reads and writes.

One Pydantic model that flows through the graph. Each node receives
the full state, may set fields it owns, and returns either the same
state or a partial update (LangGraph merges).

Field ownership:

  - `application_id`        : set by the runner at cycle start; read-only thereafter.
  - `cycle_id`              : set by the runner once AuditStore.start_cycle() returns it.
  - `input_validation_passed`: set by the input-harness gate node.
  - `analysis_plan`         : set by the System Mapper node.
  - `specialists_invoked`   : set by the Supervisor node. In Phase 11a this is always [].
  - `specialist_findings`   : set by tier specialists in Phase 11b+. Empty in 11a.
  - `evaluator_record`      : set by the Cross-Tier Evaluator in Phase 11d+. None in 11a.
  - `recommendation`        : set by the Cross-Tier Evaluator in Phase 11d+. None in 11a.
  - `terminal_state`        : set by the cycle-complete node. One of:
                                "completed"        — cycle ran clean to end
                                "rejected_input"   — Input Harness blocked at the gate
                                "no_specialists"   — Supervisor invoked zero specialists
                                "failed"           — uncaught exception in a node
  - `failure_reason`        : human-readable string when terminal_state != "completed".

The state is locked at this shape from 11a onward. Specialists in 11b
will append to `specialist_findings`. The Cross-Tier Evaluator in 11d
will set `evaluator_record` and `recommendation`. No node ever rewrites
a field that another node owns.
