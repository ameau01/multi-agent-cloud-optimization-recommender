"""Supervisor node.

The Supervisor reads the System Mapper's `AnalysisPlan` and decides
what to do next. In Phase 11a the decision is hard-coded: the
Supervisor never fans out to specialists; it always terminates the
cycle with `decision_type="complete"` and `terminal_state="no_specialists"`.
Phase 11a.3-5 rewrites the body to a real state machine that routes
to dispatch_system_mapper, dispatch_specialists, synthesize, gate,
or complete based on what's been gathered.

What lands in the audit trail:
  - One `supervisor_decision` row per Supervisor call. The
    `SupervisorDecisionContent` shape (src/models/audit.py) is
    type-discriminated by `decision_type` (one of SupervisorDecisionType).
  - Every decision carries `evidence_refs` — the audit_records ids the
    decision relied on. In 11a the only upstream evidence is the
    system_mapper_output row, so that's what we cite.

The Supervisor records WHY it chose what it chose. In 11a the reason
is always "skeleton mode — specialists not yet wired"; the framing is
explicit so a reviewer can tell at-a-glance that the cycle was a
skeleton run, not a failed fan-out.
