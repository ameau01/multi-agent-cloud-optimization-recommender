"""LangGraph orchestrator: wires the cycle as a state machine.

The graph in Phase 11a:

    START
      ↓
    input_validation_gate
      ↓ (passed)                 ↓ (rejected)
    system_mapper                cycle_complete(rejected_input)
      ↓
    supervisor
      ↓
    cycle_complete(completed | no_specialists)
      ↓
    END

Phases 11b–11d add specialist nodes and the cross-tier evaluator
between supervisor and cycle_complete; the graph builder grows but
the agent wiring above remains intact.

Public API:
  - `build_graph(...)` returns a compiled LangGraph application.
  - `orchestrate(scenario)` retains the original stub signature for
    callers built before the runner landed; it now delegates to the
    public runner.
