"""Public entry point for running one cycle.

    from src.agents.runner import run_cycle
    cycle_id = run_cycle("app-08")

Responsibilities:

  1. Load .env so LangSmith env vars (`LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`,
     `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, `LANGSMITH_PROJECT`, `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`)
     are picked up by langchain's auto-instrumentation.
  2. Open the audit store, build the harnesses.
  3. `start_cycle` writes the cycle_started row and returns a new
     cycle_id.
  4. Build the LangGraph application and invoke it with an initial
     CycleState.
  5. `complete_cycle` writes the cycle_completed row regardless of
     how the graph terminated. This pair brackets the run so the
     audit trail's begin/end tags are always in place even when a
     node raises.

The store, harnesses, and audit DB path are injectable for tests.
Production callers just call `run_cycle(application_id)` and let the
defaults take care of everything.
